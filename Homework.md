# Homework

These are 2 ideas for a simple website, there are progressive challenges. So if you just manage to do the initial challenge or all the way to completion, there are plenty basic *tasks * of modern webdev to practice.

### Your stack, your rules:

You decide what you want to use, be it `React`, `jQuery`, plain vanilla `JS` with `axios/fetch`or whatever else works for you (Ruby on Rails anyone???) . If you managed it in plain `JS`, try it with `jQuery` or `React` just to see the differences in execution.

Write in `codepen` or your own environment, codepen is easier to review online.

| Objective                    | show quotes                                                  | display the weather                                          |
| MVP (minimal viable product) | single quote on running of program                           | shows current temperature etc                                |
| ideas to increase difficulty | - get a new quote on button press<br />-show a list of authors at the bottom of the page<br />-make it pretty, center in page etc<br />-fetch image of author and show it with the quote | - show current weather for fixed location<br />-allow user to input ZIP code/location and get the weather<br />-use geolocation API<br />-make a nice graphical representation of forecast<br />- use https://erikflowers.github.io/weather-icons/ |
| Publish it:                  | use surge.sh                                                 | or any other service to get it on the web!                   |

**Read up on the problems but try to do the actual code yourself, not just copy/paste the whole solution.**

Ask on Slack for help if you're stuck, in `codepen` it's easier to share your current code than otherwise.
